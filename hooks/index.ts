/**
 * Hooks Implementation - Decorator Pattern
 * 
 * This file implements the Decorator Pattern through command hooks. These hooks
 * allow capabilities to be added to commands without modifying their code.
 * 
 * WHAT IS THE DECORATOR PATTERN?
 * The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically.
 * Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD BENEFITS:
 * 1. Separation of Concerns: Core business logic in commands, cross-cutting concerns in hooks
 * 2. Reusability: The same hooks can be applied to different commands
 * 3. Composability: Hooks can be mixed and matched to create different capability stacks
 * 4. Open/Closed Principle: Extend functionality without modifying existing code
 * 
 * ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:
 * - Inheritance: Create subclasses for each combination of capabilities (class explosion)
 * - Aspect-Oriented Programming: Use aspects to inject cross-cutting concerns (more complex)
 * - Direct Modification: Add capabilities directly to command code (tight coupling)
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS BETTER:
 * The decorator approach keeps commands focused on business logic while allowing
 * technical concerns to be added declaratively. This makes the system more modular,
 * testable, and maintainable.
 * 
 * HOW HOOKS WORK WITH THE BUILDER PATTERN:
 * The "withX" methods in the command builder create a fluent interface for adding
 * these hooks to commands. This combination of Builder and Decorator patterns
 * creates a powerful, expressive way to compose capabilities.

 * 1. Commands stay focused on business logic

 * 3. Logging implementation can be changed without affecting commands
