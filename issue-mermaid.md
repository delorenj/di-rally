## Add Mermaid diagrams to visualize design patterns

We need to add Mermaid diagrams to our documentation to help visualize the design patterns used in this project and their benefits. This will help junior developers understand why patterns matter.

### Goals:
- Create Mermaid diagrams for key design patterns (DI, Builder, Command, etc.)
- Add diagrams to compare pattern vs. no-pattern approaches
- Visualize the relationships between components
- Show how the patterns work together in the system

### Implementation details:
- Add diagrams to main README.md
- Add comparison diagrams to no-patterns-example/comparison.md
- Ensure diagrams are clear and educational
- Include explanatory text with each diagram

### Value:
- Makes design patterns more accessible to junior developers
- Provides visual learning alongside code examples
- Helps sell the benefits of using patterns
- Improves documentation quality
